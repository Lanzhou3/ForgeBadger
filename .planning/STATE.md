# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably control and recover local AI CLI coding sessions from a browser without losing tenant isolation, credential boundaries, terminal persistence, or auditability.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — first user product hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-20 -- Phase 02 complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: n/a

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Beta Evidence Closure | 4/4 | 54min | 13.5min |
| Phase 01 P01 | 18min | 4 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 10min | 3 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 01 P03 | 8min | 3 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 01 P04 | 18min | 3 tasks | 3 files |
| 01 | 4 | - | - |
| 02 | 2 | - | - |
| 2. Public Feishu Webhook Safety | 2/2 | 67min | 33.5min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` and `.planning/DECISIONS-INDEX.md`.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keep the local-first AI CLI control plane as the product wedge.
- Close external evidence before expanding remote/autonomous features.
- Keep Codex app-server prompt/turn input disabled by default.
- Treat Feishu as a controlled Copilot collaboration channel, not execution authority.

### Pending Todos

None in `.planning/todos/` yet. Current backlog is represented by `.planning/ROADMAP.md`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 evidence closure is complete with explicit caveats, not false Pass claims.
- Live Copilot provider evidence remains `Caveat` until a disposable provider credential and explicit model id are available.
- Physical Windows/WSL evidence remains `Caveat` until a real Windows/WSL host completes the terminal checklist.
- First-user feedback remains `Caveat` until completed feedback is attached and mapped.
- Phase 1 security verification is complete with `01-SECURITY.md` verified and no open threats.
- Phase 2 public Feishu webhook safety is complete: signature verification, replay protection, persistent rate limiting, and fail-closed policy semantics are implemented and tested.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Remote execution | SSH/remote execution implementation | Separate architecture phase | GSD bootstrap |
| Codex app-server | Web prompt/turn input | Disabled until transcript/security design | GSD bootstrap |
| Feishu | Free-form approvals and terminal input | Out of scope | GSD bootstrap |
